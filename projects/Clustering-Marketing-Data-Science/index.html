But this project explores how a similar clustering approach can be used to segment audiences at the top stage of the funnel, i.e., those that are in the awareness stage and may not have converted yet. Brands spend a lot of time and resources trying to understand their audience before they convert to a customer. Identifying the different groups or clusters of audience characteristics at this stage will help marketers device appropriate strategies, campaigns and tactics to ensure that they target those visitors with the best chance of converting and building loyalty with them further down the line.</p> <p>In this project, we performed clustering of the web visitors to Google’s Merchandise Store using kMeans clustering, using their web analytics data. The clustering stage is preceded by the standard steps of data science, including cleaning, exploration, feature selectiona and preprocessing.</p> <h2 id="data-collection"><strong>Data Collection</strong></h2> <p>The data used for this project are from select files used for the Google Customer Revenue Prediction Competition on Kaggle.</p> <p>The first dataset involves 903653 observations of visits to Google’s Merchandise Store for a period of a year between the 1st of August 2016 to 1st of August 2017.</p> <p>The second is another dataset related to this same Google store data, that includes more numerical variables like Sessions, Average Session Duration, Bounce Rate, Transcations and Goal Conversion Rate. This was not part of the original Kaggle competition but it came to be as a result of a “leak” in the competition dataset which sparked some discussion in their forum after which the competition was shut down. https://www.kaggle.com/c/ga-customer-revenue-prediction/discussion/68235#401950</p> <p>The data has been provided by a Kaggle user in corresponding csv files here https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/satian/exported-google-analytics-data?select=Train_external_data_2.csv. We can use this to marge into the first dataset when needed.</p> <h2 id="data-exploration"><strong>Data Exploration</strong></h2> <p>Some observations from exploring the data:</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/Exploration-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/Exploration-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/Exploration-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/AudSeg/Exploration.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>From these graphs, we can see that:</p> <ul> <li> <p>Channels: Google search is the most popular source of visits, followed by Social channels and Direct.

Then comes Android users on mobile, followed by iOS users. This may just be useful to get an idea of visitors’ “lifestyle choices,” such as their preferred operating systems (for example, Mac users versus PC users).</p> </li> </ul> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/countries-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/countries-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/countries-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/AudSeg/countries.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>The US, India, UK, Canada and Vietnam are the top 5 countries sending traffic.</p> <p>It is also useful to explore how the visits change over time, throughout the year and on a weekly basis to see if there are any patterns we can take advantage of in the eventual clustering.</p> <div class="row"> <div class="col-sm mt-3 mt-md-0"> <figure> <picture> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 480px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/time-480.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 800px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/time-800.webp"></source> <source class="responsive-img-srcset" media="(max-width: 1400px)" srcset="/assets/img/AudSeg/time-1400.webp"></source> <img src="/assets/img/AudSeg/time.png" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" width="auto" height="auto" title="example image" onerror="this.onerror=null; $('.responsive-img-srcset').remove();"> </picture> </figure> </div> </div> <p>As we can see here, the store experienced a higher number of visits during the period from October to January.

However, it is important to note that this observation may not provide a valuable insight due to visitors coming from different time zones.

For example, the 4 main clusters that could be of use to a marketing team could be:</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cluster 1</strong> : Visitors are Mac users who arrive at the Google Store from external links to the Google Store, on Chrome browsers in their desktops AND view only a few pages, don’t spend much time on them but spend a moderate amount of money</li> </ul> <p>So an appropriate strategy for this cluster could be phrased as: “Let’s create content and product info that is Apple compatible, that can be shared by other websites, and not have each page be too long”</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cluster 2</strong> : Most mobile visitors are from this, they use Safari on an iPhone, view a moderate number of pages and spend some decent amount of time on the session and also spend a decent amount of money.</li> </ul> <p>For which, a strategy could be: “Let’s mobile-optimize most of our content, focus on products that are also Apple-compatible, spread across a few pages and with enough detail to help them make the purchase”</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cluster 3</strong> : Most Android phone users on a Windows OS are from here, but they tend to search on Google and click links to land on the Google Store, view only a few pages and spend little time but spend a lot of money.</li> </ul> <p>Where the strategy could be phrased as: “Let’s also focus on Android and non-Mac users, create SEO optimized content but not too many pages of them”</p> <ul> <li> <strong>Cluster 4</strong> : Has the most Linux users, Direct visits, some mobile users and some Safari users but all other behaviour remains similar to cluster 1.</li> </ul> <p>For which the approach could be: “Maybe it is also worth appealing to Linux users, especially those who return a lot, on mobile”</p> <h2 id="conclusion"><strong>Conclusion</strong></h2> <p>This analysis shows an approach to website audience clustering that marketers can adopt. It uses unsupervised machine learning in the form of the kMeans clustering algorithm.</p> <p>Roughly speaking, the idea is to give marketers a data-driven method to categorize their website audience into different groups, while taking into account all the available features of their visits at the same time, instead of one or two.</p> <p>It is important to note that the clustering approach can also be subjective to a certain extent, so marketing teams can choose a clustering that best fits their needs. For example, the very choice of the number of clusters is something that needs to be arrived at based on an educated guess, experience with real world interactions with customers or industry best practices.</p> <p>This analysis can also be improved further by ingesting additional data from other sources. For example, since the above clustering is still purel based on web analytics data, it can be combined with CRM data or other sales data acquired through sales teams, surveys or feedback forms. This will mean more accurate sets of variables that closely capture audience and buyer characteristics. This will allow marketers for example, to do more targeted ad campaigns for high spending customers.</p> <p>One practical way in which this kind of clustering can be operationalized in the real world is through a user-friendly dashboard that automatically creates various segments of customer IDs in the CRM database based on the customer and purchase information and also all the web analytics data to give marketing teams and sales teams:</p> <ul> <li> <p>a choice or sequence of stages in which to approach potential shoppers close to conversion</p> </li> <li> <p>clusters of website visitors who are showing interesting content based behaviour but may not be purchasing, which can be used to create content to make them purchase</p> </li> <li> <p>clusters of website visitors who show patterns of leaving or ending their purchase patterns, who can be nudged to continue purchasing</p> </li> <li> <p>automatic assignment of a new website visitor into a specific cluster (say one of high spending repeat visitors) based on their initial digital behavior.</p> </li> </ul> </article> </div> </div> <footer class="fixed-bottom"> <div class="container mt-0"> © Copyright 2024 Suraj Karakulath. </div> </footer> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/jquery@3.6.0/dist/jquery.min.js" integrity="sha256-/xUj+3OJU5yExlq6GSYGSHk7tPXikynS7ogEvDej/m4=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script src="/assets/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js"></script> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mdbootstrap@4.20.0/js/mdb.min.js" integrity="sha256-NdbiivsvWt7VYCt6hYNT3h/th9vSTL4EDWeGs5SN3DA=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/masonry-layout@4.2.2/dist/masonry.pkgd.min.js" integrity="sha256-Nn1q/fx0H7SNLZMQ5Hw5JLaTRZp0yILA/FRexe19VdI=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/imagesloaded@4/imagesloaded.pkgd.min.js"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/masonry.js" type="text/javascript"></script> <script defer src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/medium-zoom@1.0.8/dist/medium-zoom.min.js" integrity="sha256-7PhEpEWEW0XXQ0k6kQrPKwuoIomz8R8IYyuU1Qew4P8=" crossorigin="anonymous"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/zoom.js?7b30caa5023af4af8408a472dc4e1ebb"></script> <script defer src="https://unpkg.com/bootstrap-table@1.22.1/dist/bootstrap-table.min.js"></script> <script src="/assets/js/no_defer.js?d633890033921b33e0ceb13d22340a9c"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/common.js?acdb9690d7641b2f8d40529018c71a01"></script> <script defer src="/assets/js/copy_code.js?c9d9dd48933de3831b3ee5ec9c209cac" type="text/javascript"></script> <script async src="https://d1bxh8uas1mnw7.cloudfront.net/assets/embed.js"></script> <script async src="https://badge.dimensions.ai/badge.js"></script> <script type="text/javascript">window.MathJax={tex:{tags:"ams"}};</script> <script defer type="text/javascript" id="MathJax-script" src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/mathjax@3.2.0/es5/tex-mml-chtml.js"></script> <script defer src="https://polyfill.io/v3/polyfill.min.js?features=es6"></script> <script type="text/javascript">function progressBarSetup(){"max"in document.createElement("progress")?(initializeProgressElement(),$(document).on("scroll",function(){progressBar.attr({value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}),$(window).on("resize",initializeProgressElement)):(resizeProgressBar(),$(document).on("scroll",resizeProgressBar),$(window).on("resize",resizeProgressBar))}function getCurrentScrollPosition(){return $(window).scrollTop()}function initializeProgressElement(){let e=$("#navbar").outerHeight(!0);$("body").css({"padding-top":e}),$("progress-container").css({"padding-top":e}),progressBar.css({top:e}),progressBar.attr({max:getDistanceToScroll(),value:getCurrentScrollPosition()})}function getDistanceToScroll(){return $(document).height()-$(window).height()}function resizeProgressBar(){progressBar.css({width:getWidthPercentage()+"%"})}function getWidthPercentage(){return getCurrentScrollPosition()/getDistanceToScroll()*100}const progressBar=$("#progress");window.onload=function(){setTimeout(progressBarSetup,50)};</script> </body> </html>
