I am a Data scientist with domain expertise in marketing, cybersecurity, SaaS products and technology. I have over 10 years of experience in product, strategy, content, data analytics and measurement for B2B and B2C brands, both in-house and on the agency side. I have also provided independent consulting for startups specialising in computer vision, artificial intelligence, retail, geospatial data analytics and conversational AI/chatbot development.

I grew up in India, lived and worked in Singapore for 16 years and now I'm finishing a Masters in Data Science in Bremen, Germany. *Ich lerne derzeit auch Deutsch und habe vor, bald von A2 auf B1 zu kommen.*

**My specialties in Data Science include**: Data Mining, Data Exploration, Data Modeling, Machine Learning, NLP, Time Series.
**Tools/skills that I work with**: Python, R, SQL, BigQuery, Google Analytics, Tableau, Google Data Studio, PowerBI 

Some projects that I am proud of:
- <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Time-Series-Price-Determination/"> Time series analysis to identify determinants of waste price </a>
- <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Clustering-Marketing-Data-Science/"> Unsupervised clustering to segment website audiences (not customer segmentation) </a>
- <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/NLP-ChatGPT-Bias/"> Using NLP to detect political bias in ChatGPT responses </a>
- <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Climate-Data-Analysis/"> Quantifying global temperature rise from climate change data </a>

My other interests include technology, cinema and film history, music, politics, psychology and science.

When I'm not working, I'm usually 
- travelling (mostly Europe now since I am here)
- reading (non-fiction - psychology, science, humanism; fiction - classics)
- watching films (classics - a bit obsessed with Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin these days) or checking out what's on at local arthouse theatres 
- learning German
- or catching up with friends.
