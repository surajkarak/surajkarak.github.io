**Tools/skills that I work with**: 
- Python in VSCode

My other interests include technology, cinema and film history, music, politics, psychology and science.

When I'm not working, I'm usually 
- travelling (mostly Europe now since I am here)
- reading (non-fiction - psychology, science, humanism; fiction - classics)
- watching films (classics - a bit obsessed with Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin these days) or checking out what's on at local arthouse theatres 
- learning German
- or catching up with friends
