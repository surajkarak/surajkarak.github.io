I am a Data scientist with domain expertise in marketing (my previous career), cybersecurity, SaaS products and technology. I have over 10 years of experience in product, strategy, content, data analytics and measurement for B2B and B2C brands, both in-house and on the agency side. I have also provided independent consulting for startups specialising in computer vision, artificial intelligence, retail, geospatial data analytics and conversational AI/chatbot development.
