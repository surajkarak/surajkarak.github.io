I am an AI Data scientist with a background in marketing. I started off in copywriting, then grew into "content" and strategy development, while also handling data analytics and measurement. Over 8 years, I got to work with some leading tech enterprises and startups specialising in computer vision, artificial intelligence, geospatial data analytics and conversational AI/chatbot development, which inspired me to formally move into Data Science.

I grew up in India, lived and worked in Singapore for 16 years and now I'm based in Germany.  

**My specialties include**: 
- Data mining, data exploration and statistical modeling
- Machine learning (supervised and unsupervised)
- Deep learning 
- Natural language processing 
- Time series analysis and forecasting
- Data visualisation 

**Tools/skills that I work with**: 
- General programming: Python, R 
- IDE: Visual Studio, RStudio, Cursor, Jupyter Notebooks
- General data science and ML: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, statsmodels, NLTK, Spacy, XGBoost, 
- Deep learning: PyTorch
- Database: SQL, BigQuery, Snowflake
- Cloud: Google Cloud Platform, AWS
- Version control: Git, GitHub
- NLP: HuggingFace transformers, OpenAI GPT models, LangChain, LlamaIndex
- Data visualisation: matplotlib, seaborn, plotly for packages and other specialised tools: Tableau, Google Data Studio (Looker Studio), PowerBI, Streamlit
- Web analytics: Google Analytics, Search Console, Adobe Analytics, HubSpot


Some projects that I did for work include <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Time-Series-Forecasting/"> a time series forecasting study </a> in non-transparent markets using ARIMA, XGBoost and Prophet for a market-leading energy supplier in Germany, <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Clustering-Marketing-Data-Science/"> an unsupervised clustering </a> of website audiences into different segments and an attempt at <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Climate-Data-Analysis/"> quantifying global temperature rise from climate change data </a>.

Some sideprojects that I had fun with include  <a href= "https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/Spotify-API-Data-Extraction-Visualization/"> an interactive visualisation of audio features of The Beatles songs </a> using Spotify API, another <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/NLP-Sentiment-Analysis-Star-Trek/"> interactive visualisation of characters' sentiment </a> from the scripts of the Star Trek (original) series and <a href="https://surajkarak.github.io/projects/NLP-ChatGPT-Bias/"> an analysis to detect political bias in ChatGPT responses </a>  using NLP.


My other interests include technology, cinema and film history, music, politics, psychology and science.

When I'm not working, I'm usually 
- travelling (mostly Europe now since I am here)
- reading (non-fiction - psychology, science, humanism; fiction - classics)
- watching films (classics - a bit obsessed with Danny Boyle and Aaron Sorkin these days) or checking out what's on at local arthouse theatres 
- learning German
- or catching up with friends
